# Build "Snake" in the Terminal

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner (Est. 1 Hour)

## Project Description
Recreate the classic snake game in the command line. This project uses the `curses` standard library (do not use Pygame) to control the terminal cursor and read non-blocking key presses. It reinforces data structures (a list for the snake's body) and the main game loop. This is a "capstone" for the beginner section.

## Possible Folder Structure
```
terminal_snake/
└── main.py
```

## Inputs and Expected Outputs
- **Input:** Keyboard arrow keys
- **Output:** A real-time game rendered with ASCII characters in the terminal window

## Learning Objectives
- Curses library usage
- Game loop implementation
- Real-time input handling
- Data structure management
