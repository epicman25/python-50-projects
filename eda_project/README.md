# Standardized Data Science Project (EDA)

**Difficulty Level:** Advanced (Est. 4-6 Hours)

## Project Description
Perform a comprehensive Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a complex dataset (e.g., Titanic or a Kaggle dataset). The primary requirement is to use the **cookiecutter-data-science** template structure. This forces a professional workflow: data in `data/raw`, cleaning scripts in `src/`, and analysis in `notebooks/`.

## Possible Folder Structure
```
eda_project/
├── data/
│   ├── raw/         # (Original data.csv)
│   ├── processed/   # (Cleaned data.csv)
├── notebooks/
│   └── 1.0-eda.ipynb # (Analysis notebook)
├── reports/
│   └── figures/     # (Plots saved from notebook)
├── src/
│   ├── __init__.py
│   ├── data.py      # (Script to process data)
│   └── features.py  # (Script to build features)
└── requirements.txt
```

## Inputs and Expected Outputs
- **Input:** `data/raw/train.csv`
- **Output:** A fully populated `notebooks/1.0-eda.ipynb` with insights and plots, and a `data/processed/train.csv` file generated by `src/data.py`

## Learning Objectives
- Professional data science workflow
- Cookiecutter template usage
- Exploratory data analysis
- Data visualization techniques
- Reproducible research practices
