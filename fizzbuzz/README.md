# FizzBuzz

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner (Est. 1 Hour)

## Project Description
The classic "FizzBuzz" problem. Write a script that prints numbers from 1 to 100. For multiples of 3, print "Fizz" instead of the number. For multiples of 5, print "Buzz". For multiples of both 3 and 5, print "FizzBuzz". This is a core test of `for` loops and conditional logic (`if/elif/else`).

## Possible Folder Structure
```
fizzbuzz/
└── main.py
```

## Inputs and Expected Outputs
- **Output:** `1, 2, Fizz, 4, Buzz, Fizz, 7, 8, Fizz, Buzz, 11, Fizz, 13, 14, FizzBuzz,...`

## Learning Objectives
- For loops
