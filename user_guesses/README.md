# Guess the Number (User)

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner (Est. 1 Hour)

## Project Description
A reversal of the previous game. The user thinks of a secret number, and the computer tries to guess it. The user provides feedback ("high," "low," "correct"). This project forces a different logical approach (like a binary search) for the computer's guessing strategy.

## Possible Folder Structure
```
user_guesses/
└── main.py
```

## Inputs and Expected Outputs
- **Input:** User provides feedback: `Is your number 50? (h/l/c): h`
- **Output:** Computer's next guess: `Is your number 75? (h/l/c):...`

## Learning Objectives
- Binary search algorithm
- Computer AI logic
- User input validation
- Game loop structure
