# Pygame Snake

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Est. 2-3 Hours)

## Project Description
Recreate the classic game Snake using `pygame`. This requires OOP: you will likely have a `Snake` class (managing its body segments, direction) and a `Food` class. The `main.py` will contain the main game loop, which handles events (key presses), updates game state, and draws to the screen.

## Possible Folder Structure
```
pygame_snake/
├── main.py
├── snake.py       # (Snake class)
├── food.py        # (Food class)
└── requirements.txt
```

## Inputs and Expected Outputs
- **Input:** Keyboard arrow keys
- **Output:** A graphical game window where the user controls a snake

## Learning Objectives
- Game development with Pygame
- Object-oriented game design
- Graphics and animation
- Game loop implementation
