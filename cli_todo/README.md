# Simple To-Do List (CLI)

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner (Est. 1 Hour)

## Project Description
A basic command-line to-do list. The script should use a loop that repeatedly asks the user what they want to do ("add", "view", "remove", "quit"). Tasks are stored in a simple Python list. The program ends when the user types "quit". This focuses on list methods (`.append()`, `.remove()`) and `while` loops.

## Possible Folder Structure
```
cli_todo/
└── main.py
```

## Inputs and Expected Outputs
- **Input:** `> add Buy milk`, `> view`
- **Output:** `1. Buy milk`
- **Input:** `> quit`
- **Output:** `Goodbye!`

## Learning Objectives
- List operations
- While loops
- Menu-driven programs
- Task management logic
