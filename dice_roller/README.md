# Dice Rolling Simulator

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner (Est. 1 Hour)

## Project Description
Simulate rolling one or more dice. The user specifies how many dice to roll and how many sides each die has (e.g., two 6-sided dice). The script should print the result of each roll and the total. Uses the `random.randint()` function.

## Possible Folder Structure
```
dice_roller/
└── main.py
```

## Inputs and Expected Outputs
- **Input:** `How many dice? 2`, `How many sides? 6`
- **Output:** `Roll 1: 4`, `Roll 2: 3`, `Total: 7`

## Learning Objectives
- Random number generation
- Loop structures
- Mathematical operations
- Simulation programming
