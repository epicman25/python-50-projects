# Pygame Pong

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Est. 2-3 Hours)

## Project Description
Implement the classic "Pong" game using `pygame`. This will involve creating `Paddle` objects (controlled by the user) and a `Ball` object. The logic will need to handle ball movement, collision detection with walls and paddles, and score-keeping.

## Possible Folder Structure
```
pygame_pong/
├── main.py
├── ball.py        # (Ball class)
├── paddle.py      # (Paddle class)
└── requirements.txt
```

## Inputs and Expected Outputs
- **Input:** "W" and "S" keys for one paddle, Up and Down arrows for the other
- **Output:** A graphical two-player Pong game

## Learning Objectives
- Advanced game development
- Collision detection
- Two-player game mechanics
- Physics simulation
