# Simple Scikit-Learn Model

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Est. 2-3 Hours)

## Project Description
Build your first "real" end-to-end machine learning model. Use the "Wine Quality" dataset (a common CSV dataset). Load it with `pandas`, separate features (X) and target (y), perform a `train_test_split`, and then train a `RandomForestClassifier` from scikit-learn to predict the wine quality. Print the model's accuracy.

## Possible Folder Structure
```
wine_model/
├── model.ipynb
├── data/
│   └── wine.csv
└── requirements.txt
```

## Inputs and Expected Outputs
- **Input:** `wine.csv`
- **Output:** A printed accuracy score: `Model Accuracy: 0.68`

## Learning Objectives
- Machine learning fundamentals
- Scikit-learn usage
- Model training and evaluation
- Data preprocessing
