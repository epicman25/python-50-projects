# Rock, Paper, Scissors

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner (Est. 1 Hour)

## Project Description
Implement the classic game against the computer. The script should get the user's choice, have the computer make a random choice, and then determine and announce the winner based on the rules. This reinforces `random.choice()` and handling user input validation (e.g., what if the user types "rockk"?).

## Possible Folder Structure
```

└── main.py
```

## Inputs and Expected Outputs
- **Input:** `Enter your choice (rock, paper, scissors): rock`
- **Output:** `Computer chose paper. You lose!`

## Learning Objectives
