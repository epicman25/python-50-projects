# Tic-Tac-Toe AI

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Est. 2-3 Hours)

## Project Description
Build a Tic-Tac-Toe game where the human plays against an "unbeatable" computer AI. This project introduces the **minimax algorithm**, a recursive algorithm used for decision-making in two-player games. This is a significant step up from a simple game.

## Possible Folder Structure
```
tictactoe_ai/
├── main.py
└── game.py
```

## Inputs and Expected Outputs
- **Input:** User makes moves in the terminal
- **Output:** The computer makes optimal counter-moves, resulting in a draw or a win for the AI

## Learning Objectives
- Minimax algorithm implementation
- Game tree search
- AI decision making
- Advanced game logic
