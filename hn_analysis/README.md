# Exploring Hacker News Posts (Pandas)

**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Est. 2-3 Hours)

## Project Description
Use the `pandas` library to analyze a CSV file of Hacker News posts. This project, which can be done in a Jupyter Notebook, involves loading the data (`pd.read_csv`), filtering for specific post types (e.g., Ask HN vs. Show HN), and performing aggregate calculations (e.g., find the mean number of comments for each post type).
