# Find and Replace (File I/O)

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner (Est. 1 Hour)

## Project Description
Write a script that prompts the user for a filename, a word to find, and a word to replace it with. The script should read the file, perform the replacements, and write the new text to a new file (e.g., `output.txt`). This expands on file I/O, combining reading and writing.

## Possible Folder Structure
```
find_replace/
├── main.py
└── sample.txt
```

## Inputs and Expected Outputs
- **Input:** `Filename: sample.txt`, `Find: "apple"`, `Replace: "orange"`
- **Output:** A file `output.txt` with all instances of "apple" replaced

## Learning Objectives
- File reading and writing
- String replacement
- Text processing
- File manipulation
