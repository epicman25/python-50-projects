# Word Count Tool

**Difficulty Level:** Beginner (Est. 1 Hour)

## Project Description
Create a script that reads a text file (`input.txt`) and counts the total number of words. A more advanced version could also count the frequency of each word. This introduces basic file I/O using `with open(...) as f:` and using string methods like `.split()`.

## Possible Folder Structure
```
word_count/
├── main.py
└── input.txt
```

## Inputs and Expected Outputs
- **Input:** A file `input.txt` containing "Hello world hello"
- **Output:** `Total words: 3`

## Learning Objectives
- File I/O operations
- String splitting
- Word counting algorithms
- Text processing
