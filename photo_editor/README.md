**Difficulty Level:** Intermediate (Est. 2-3 Hours)

## Project Description
Use `tkinter` for the GUI and the Pillow (PIL) library for image processing. The application should allow a user to open an image file, and then apply simple filters like "Grayscale," "Blur," or "Sharpen," and finally save the new image.

## Possible Folder Structure
```
photo_editor/
├── main.py
└── requirements.txt
```

## Inputs and Expected Outputs
- **Input:** User clicks "Open" and selects `image.jpg`. User clicks "Grayscale"
- **Output:** The image in the GUI window turns to grayscale. User can "Save As"

## Learning Objectives
- Image processing with PIL
- GUI applications
- File dialogs
- Image manipulation techniques
